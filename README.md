# Hi there 👋


### “Being a student is easy. Learning requires actual work.”  - William Crawford

My life gist :

- 🔭 I’m currently working on C2C Platform which access people to Buy/sell goods locally.
- 📚 It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manange my time and stay updated.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me.
- 💬 Ask me about Web Development, SQL, NoSQL, NodeJs, JavaScript, 
- 📫 How to reach me: [shubham121gupta](https://github.com/shubham121gupta)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Cold Coffee ☕

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game.
